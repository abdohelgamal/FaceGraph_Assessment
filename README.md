You can use this application to report issues from your life or work events and activities locally on the phone storage.
You can give the issue a title , a description , a status for the issue and an image showing or describing the issue.
You can also set a location where the issue happened using Google Maps (optionally).
You can create , delete , show and delete the issues any time.


Bloc Pattern was used for state management.

Sqflite was used for local storage.

MVC an architectural pattern was also used to seperate code components , classes , logic and UI.
